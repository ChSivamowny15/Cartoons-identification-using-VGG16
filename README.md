# Cartoons-identification-using-VGG16
This project applies the VGG16 deep learning model with transfer learning to identify and classify cartoon characters. It preprocesses images, trains the model, and fine-tunes it for high accuracy. The system can be used in content filtering, animation tagging, and educational tools, with scope for real-time deployment.
